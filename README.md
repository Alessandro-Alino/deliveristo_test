Hello! This is A simple App to show images of star dogs by breeds and sub breeds.

Hello! My name is Alessandro Anzini, and I developed the application by dividing the interface into 4 pageviews, to be scrolled horizontally on mobile or using the arrows for desktop or web. The pages are divided like this:

Page 1: Random Image by Breed. a dropdown button to select the breed, a Card where the photo of the dog will be shown based on the selected breed.

Page 2: Images List by Breed. a dropdownbutton to select the breed, a GridView where the list of dog photos will be shown based on the selected breed.

Page 3: Random Image by Breed and Sub Breed. Two dropdownbuttons to select the breed, and based on the first breed selected, the second dropdownbutton will contain the list of Sub Breeds. A photo of the dog will be shown in a Card based on the selected breed and sub breed.

Page 4: Images List by Breed. Two dropdownbuttons to select the breed, and based on the first selected breed, the second dropdownbutton will contain the list of Sub Breeds. a GridView where the list of dog photos will be shown based on the selected breed.

For state management I used BLoC.

An e2e test completed only to receive the "Random image by breed" on the first page. Thanks.
